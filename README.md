Project Overview
This project examines the impact of Artificial Intelligence (AI) on digital media from 2020 to 2025. It explores trends in AI adoption, content creation, economic effects, public perception, and human-AI collaboration across various industries. The analysis aims to provide insights into how AI is shaping industries, from media and gaming to automotive and legal sectors.

# Key Objectives
Analyze global AI adoption and content generation trends in digital media.

Investigate the economic effects of AI, including revenue growth and job displacement.

Examine public trust and perception of AI in media and content creation.

Explore AI tools used in industries and assess regulatory landscapes.

# Data and Methodology
The data is collected from various industries worldwide, covering AI adoption rates, revenue growth, content volume, job displacement, and human-AI collaboration.

Visualizations such as scatter plots, heatmaps, and bar charts were used to identify patterns, correlations, and trends.

Categorical analysis was conducted to explore the distribution of AI adoption across different industries and countries.

# Tools Used
Python Libraries: Pandas, Matplotlib, Seaborn

Data Processing: Correlation analysis, data cleaning, and exploration

Visualization: Bar charts, scatter plots, heatmaps

# Results and Insights
AI adoption rates vary across sectors, with significant growth in media and gaming.
